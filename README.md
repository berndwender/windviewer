# windviewer
Displays weather data (wind speed, temperature) gathered from a weather station.

This is a very simple viewer application using an xchart graph.
Currently it supports the data format of the weather station at Upside Down surf shop in Podersdorf, Austria.
The data are available in real time at http://212.232.26.104/
I started this off as a one day project because my favourite wind data viewer went out of service recently.
If anybody likes to extend this project, please feel free to do so.
